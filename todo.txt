* correctly render multipolygons with weird shapes (e.g., https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5625085)
* get rid of Cap'N'Proto
* implement icon-image/fill-image (this will require loading external files when mapcss files are parsed)
* try to integrate the maps.me stylesheet if their mapcss dialect is not too different from the official spec
* draw labels (probably the hardest part; maybe look at font-rs for inspiration)
