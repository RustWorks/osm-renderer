Must have:
  * draw labels (probably the hardest part; maybe look at font-rs for inspiration)
  * implement the algo from https://blog.mapbox.com/a-new-algorithm-for-finding-a-visual-center-of-a-polygon-7c77e6492fbc
  * render meta-tiles to avoid text/icon clipping

Nice to have:
  * correctly render multipolygons with touching inner rings (e.g., https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4485484)
  * make the import process less memory-hungry
