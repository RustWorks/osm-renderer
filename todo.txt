Goals:
* render multipolygonal relations (rivers are mostly broken without them)
* implement icon-image/fill-image (this will require loading external files when mapcss files are parsed)
* try to integrate the maps.me stylesheet if their mapcss dialect is not too different from the official spec
* draw labels (probably the hardest part; maybe look at font-rs for inspiration)

Non-goals:
* line-join attribute (makes virtually zero visual difference, hard to implement)
* live mapcss reloading (should be not too hard to implement but the renderer starts almost instantly as it is)
