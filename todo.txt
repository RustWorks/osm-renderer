* get rid of Cap'N'Proto
* implement icon-image/fill-image (this will require loading external files when mapcss files are parsed)
* try to integrate the maps.me stylesheet if their mapcss dialect is not too different from the official spec
* draw labels (probably the hardest part; maybe look at font-rs for inspiration)
* correctly render multipolygons with touching inner rings (e.g., https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4485484)

* memory
  + make the import process less memory-hungry;
  + configurable drawing cache size.
