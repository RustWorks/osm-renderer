Must have:
  * improve rendering performance
  * implement the algo from https://blog.mapbox.com/a-new-algorithm-for-finding-a-visual-center-of-a-polygon-7c77e6492fbc

Nice to have:
  * correctly render multipolygons with touching inner rings (e.g., https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4485484)
  * make the import process less memory-hungry
